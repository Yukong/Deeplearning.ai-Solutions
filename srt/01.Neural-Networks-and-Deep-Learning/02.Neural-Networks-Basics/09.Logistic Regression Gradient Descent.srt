00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,330
welcome back, in this video we'll talk
欢迎回来 在本节我们将讨论

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,860
about how to compute derivatives for you
怎样计算偏导数

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,782
to implement gradient descent for
来实现逻辑回归的梯度下降算法

4
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:08,913
logistic regression. the key take aways
它的核心关键点是

5
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:11,156
will be what you need to implement that
其中有几个重要的公式

6
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:12,775
are the key equations you need in order
用来实现关于逻辑回归的

7
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:15,736
to implement gradient descent for
梯度下降算法

8
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:18,272
logistic regression. but in this video I
但是在本节视频中

9
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:20,394
want to do this computation using the
我将使用 导数计算图 的方式来计算梯度

10
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:22,832
computation graph. I have to admit using
虽然使用导数计算图

11
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:25,104
the computation graph is a little bit of
来计算逻辑回归的梯度下降

12
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:27,276
an overkill for deriving gradient
有点大材小用了

13
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,411
descent for logistic regression. but I
但是 我认为

14
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,205
want to start explaining things this way
以这种方式来讲解

15
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:33,592
to get you familiar with these ideas. so
可以更好地理解梯度下降

16
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,097
that hopefully you'll make a bit more
从而在讨论神经网络时 可以

17
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:36,614
sense when we talk about full fledged
更深刻而全面地

18
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:37,796
neural networks
理解神经网络

19
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:40,626
so let's dive into gradient
接下来开始学习

20
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:44,814
descent for logistic regression. to recap
逻辑回归的梯度下降算法

21
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:48,002
we had set up logistic regression as
回想一下逻辑回归的公式

22
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:51,363
follows your predictions y hat is
y~定义如下 y~=a=sigma(z)

23
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:56,764
defined as follows where z is that and
其中的z=w^T*x+b

24
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:59,966
if we focus on just one example for now
现在只考虑单个样本的情况

25
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:03,010
then the loss or respect to that one
关于该样本的损失函数定义如下

26
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,973
example is defined as follows where a is
L(a,y)=-(ylog(a)+(1-y)log(1-a)) 其中a是

27
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:08,151
the output of the logistic regression and y
逻辑回归的输出 y是

28
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,305
is the ground truth label so let's write
样本的标签值 现在写出该样本的

29
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,698
this out as a computation graph and for
偏导数计算图

30
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:17,494
this example let's say we have only two
假设样本只有两个

31
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,963
features x1 and x2. so in order to
特征x1和x2 为了

32
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:27,667
compute z, we'll need to input w1 w2 and
计算z 我们需要输入参数w1 w2 和 b

33
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,927
b in addition to the feature values x1
再包括样本特征值x1 x2

34
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,793
x2 so these things in a computation
因此用来计算z的

35
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,875
graph get used to compute z which is w1
偏导数计算公式

36
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:43,801
x1 plus w2 x2 plus b. draw a rectangle
z=w1*x1+w2*x2+b (如图用长方形括

37
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:47,807
box around that and then we compute y
起来了) 然后计算 y~

38
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:52,417
hat or a equals Sigma of Z that's the
或者 a 等于sigma(z) 也就是

39
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:55,049
next step in a computation graph and
偏导数计算图的下一步

40
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,010
then finally we compute L(a,y) and I
最后计算L(a,y)

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,289
won't copy the formula again so in
我不会再写出这个公式了

42
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,577
logistic regression what we want to do
因此在逻辑回归中我们需要做的是

43
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:09,105
is to modify the parameters w and b in
变换参数 w 和 b 的值

44
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:11,814
order to reduce this loss
来最小化损失函数函数L(a,y)

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,031
we've described before propagation steps
在前面我们已经讲解了一步一步

46
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,347
of how you actually compute the loss on
在单个训练样本上计算损失函数函数

47
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,962
a single training example now let's talk
现在让我们来

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,046
about how you can go backwards to talk
讨论怎样向后

49
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:24,644
to compute the derivatives here's the
计算偏导数 给出

50
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,544
cleaned up version of the diagram
的初始表达式如下z=w1*x1+w2*x2+b

51
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:27,942
because what we want to do is compute
要想计算损失函数L(a,y)

52
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:30,790
derivatives respect to this loss the
的偏导数

53
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,814
first thing we want to do we're going
首先我们要

54
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:35,206
backwards is to compute the derivative
向前一步先计算

55
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:38,902
of this loss with respect to the script
(dL(a,y)/da) 这是损失函数L

56
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:41,282
over there with respect to this variable
关于 变量a 的偏导数

57
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:44,303
a and so in the code you know you just
而在(Python)代码中你只需要

58
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:48,327
use da right to denote this variable
使用 da 来表示(dL(a,y)/da)

59
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:51,323
and it turns out that if you are
事实上如果你

60
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:53,661
familiar with calculus you can show that
熟悉微积分 偏导数 dL(a,y)/da 的

61
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:57,252
this ends up being negative y over a
最终结果是 -y/a

62
00:02:57,252 --> 00:03:02,839
plus one minus y over one minus a and
加上 (1-y)/(1-a)

63
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,926
the way you do that is you take the
代价函数的偏导数计算公式

64
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:06,595
formula for the loss and if you are familiar
就是这样 并且如果你对

65
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,481
with calculus you can compute the
微积分熟悉的话 你计算

66
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,115
derivative with respect to the variable
的关于 变量a 的

67
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:13,016
lowercase a and you get this formula but
偏导数就是公式dL(a,y)=(-y/a)+(1-y/1-a)

68
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:14,449
if you're not familiar of calculus don't
如果你不熟悉微积分

69
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:16,427
worry about it we'll provide the
也不必太担心 我们会列出本课程

70
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:18,926
derivative formulas you need through out
涉及的所有求导公式

71
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,500
this course so if you are a expert in
因此 如果你非常熟悉微积分

72
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,120
calculus you'll encourage you to look up
我们鼓励你主动

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,008
the formula for the loss from their
推导前面介绍的损失函数的求导公式

74
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,777
previous slide and try to get director
使用微积分直接求出

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,500
for respect to a using you know calculus
L(a,y)关于变量a的偏导数

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,091
but if you don't know enough calculus to
如果你不太了解微积分

77
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,532
do that don't worry about it
也不用太担心

78
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:35,362
now having computed this quantity or da
现在计算出 da

79
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:37,302
the derivative of your final output
关于变量a 的最终结果

80
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,824
variable respect to a you can then go
现在可以再向后一步

81
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:42,752
backwards and it turns out that you can
计算dz 你可以认为

82
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:46,918
show dz which this is the Python code
dz就是Python(一种编程语言)代码

83
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:48,977
variable name this is going to be you
中的变量名

84
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:51,692
know the derivative of the loss with
dz是代价函数关于z的偏导数(dL/dz)

85
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,788
respect to z or for L you can really write
对于dL 可以写成

86
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:58,445
the loss including a and y explicitly as
dL(a,y) 显式地包含L

87
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:01,064
parameters or not right give either type
的参数a 和 y 这两种形式

88
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,728
of notation is equally acceptable they
dL/dz 或者 dL(a,y)/dz 都是正确的

89
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:08,466
can show that this is equal to a minus y
它们(dL/dz)求导的结果等于 a-y

90
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,224
just a couple comments only for those
稍微给熟悉微积分的人

91
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:13,951
of you did a experts in
解释一下

92
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,368
calculus if you're not explain calculus
如果你对微积分不熟悉

93
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,258
don't worry about it but it turns out
也不用担心

94
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,844
that this right dL dz this can be
实际上 dL/dz 等于

95
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,814
expressed as dL da time
(dL/da)*(da/dz)

96
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,528
da dz and it turns out that da dz
并且da/dz

97
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:33,440
this turns out to be a times 1 minus a
等于a*(1-a)

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,963
and dL da we are previously worked out
而 dL/da 在前面已经计算过了

99
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,260
over here and so if you take these two
因此将这两项

100
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,880
quantities dL da which is this
dL/da 即这部分

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,316
term together with da dz which is this
和 da/dz 这部分

102
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,136
term and just take these two things and
进行相乘

103
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:48,598
multiply them you can show that you the
最终的公式

104
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:51,994
equation simplifies the a minus y so
化简成 (a-y)

105
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,758
that's how you derive it and this is
这个推导的过程

106
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:55,896
really the chain rule that I briefly
就是我之前提到过的"链式法则"(一种求导法则)

107
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,070
clue to you before ok so feel free to go
如果你对微积分熟悉

108
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,038
through that calculation yourself if you
放心地去推导

109
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,100
are knowledgeable calculus but if you
整个求导过程

110
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,652
aren't all you need to know is that you
如果不熟悉微积分 你只需要知道

111
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:07,157
can compute dz as a minus y and it
dz 等于 (a-y)

112
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:09,576
already done the calculus for you and
已经计算好了

113
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,268
then the final step in back propagation
现在最后一步向后推导

114
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:14,361
is to go back to compute how much you
就是变化 w 和 b这两个参数

115
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:18,269
need to change w and b so in particular
来计算出新的L函数 特别地

116
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:21,165
you can show that the derivative respect
损失函数L关于w1的偏导数

117
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:27,031
to w1 and will call this DW 1 that
dL/dw1 写成 dw1

118
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:30,969
this is equal to x1 times dz
等于x1*dz

119
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,582
and then similarly dw 2 which is how
同样地 dw2 写成 w2

120
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:37,396
much you want to change w2 is x2 times
的变化量 dw2等于 x2*dz

121
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:42,820
dz and b excuse me db is equal to dz so
b 不好意思应该是 db 等于dz

122
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,162
if you want to do gradient descents with
因此关于单个样本的

123
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:47,690
respect to just this one example what
梯度下降算法

124
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,668
you will do is the following you would
你所需要做的就是这些事情

125
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,988
use this formula to compute dz and then
使用公式dz=(a-y)计算dz

126
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:56,387
use these formulas to compute dw1 dw2
使用dw1=x1*dz计算dw1 dw2=x2*dz计算dw2

127
00:05:56,387 --> 00:06:00,145
and db and then you perform these
db=dz来计算db 然后

128
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:05,240
updates w1 gets updated w1 - learning
更新w1为w1减去学习率乘以dw1(w1:=w1-alpha*dw1)

129
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,999
rate alpha times dw1 w2 gets updated
类似地更新w2:=w2-alpha*dw2

130
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:12,218
similarly and B gets set as b - the
更新b为b减去学习率乘以db

131
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,946
learning rate times db and so this will
(b:=b-alpha*db) 这就是

132
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:17,342
be one step of gradicent descent with respect to a
关于单个样本实例的一次梯度更新步骤

133
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:19,908
single example so you've seen how to
现在你已经知道了

134
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:22,134
compute derivatives and implement
怎样计算导数并且实现

135
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:23,935
gradient descent for logistic regression
针对单个训练样本的

136
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:26,146
with respect to a single training
逻辑回归的梯度下降算法

137
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:28,086
example but to train logistic
但是训练逻辑回归模型

138
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,248
regression model you have not just one
不仅仅只有一个训练样本

139
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,292
training example given entire training
而是有m个训练样本的整个训练集

140
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,865
set of m training examples so

141
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:36,783
in the next video let's see how you can
因此在下一节视频中 我们将

142
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,719
take these ideas and apply them to
这些想法(知识点)应用到

143
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,952
learning not just from one example but
整个训练样本集中 而不仅仅只是

144
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,121
from an entire training set
单个样本上

145
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:42,121
