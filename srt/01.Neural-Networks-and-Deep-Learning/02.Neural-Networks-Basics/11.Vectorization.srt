1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.195
Welcome back. Vectorization is basically
欢迎回来 向量化通常是
2
00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:07.315
the art of getting rid of explicit for loops in your code.
消除你的代码中显式循环语句的艺术
3
00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:11.835
In the deep learning era safety in deep learning in practice,
在深度学习安全领域、深度学习、练习中
4
00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.210
you often find yourself training on relatively large data sets,
你经常发现你自己训练大的数据集
5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.475
because that's when deep learning algorithms tend to shine.
因为深度学习算法更加倾向于出类拔萃
6
00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:22.790
And so, it's important that your code very quickly because otherwise,
所以你的代码运行得非常快非常重要，否则
7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.525
if it's running on a big data set,
如果它运行在一个大的数据集上面
8
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.000
your code might take a long time to run then you just find
你的代码可能花费很长时间去运行，你会发现
9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.255
yourself waiting a very long time to get the result.
你将要等待非常长的时间去得到结果
10
00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.035
So in the deep learning era,
所以在深度学习领域
11
00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:37.490
I think the ability to perform vectorization has become a key skill.
我认为可以去完成向量化以及变成一个关键的技巧
12
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.010
Let's start with an example.
让我们用一个例子开始
13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.225
So, what is Vectorization?
什么是向量化？
14
00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:48.780
In logistic regression you need to compute Z equals W transpose X plus B,
在逻辑回归中，你需要去计算Z=WTX+B
15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.405
where W was this column vector and X is also this vector.
W是列向量，X也是列向量
16
00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:58.000
Maybe there are very large vectors if you have a lot of features.
如果你有很多的特征，那么就会有一个非常大的向量
17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.080
So, W and X were both these R and n R, NX dimensional vectors.
所以W和X是R内的nx维向量
18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.170
So, to compute W transpose X,
所以去计算W'X
19
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.660
if you had a non-vectorized implementation,
 如果你有一个非向量化的实现
20
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.725
you would do something like Z equals zero.
你将会做一些事情，例如Z=0
21
00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:24.860
And then for I in range of n-X.
*pythn代码   i in range(n-x)
22
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.330
So, for I equals 1, 2 NX,
*python代码  所以i=1,2....nx
23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.040
Z plus equals W I times XI.
Z+=W[i]*X[i]
24
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.100
And then maybe you do Z plus equal B at the end.
所以你在最后z+=b
25
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.855
So, that's a non-vectorized implementation.
所以，这是一个非向量化的实现
26
00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:43.090
Then you find that that's going to be really slow.
你会发现这是真的很慢
27
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.560
In contrast, a vectorized implementation would just compute W transpose X directly.
作为对比，一个向量化的实现将会非常直接计算WtX
28
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.085
In Python or a numpy,
在Python 或者numpy
29
00:01:52.085 --> 00:02:01.428
the command you use for that is Z equals np.W,
你将要为那个实现的命令是Z=np.w X
30
00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:06.270
X, so this computes W transpose X.
这是在计算WtX
31
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.075
And you can also just add B to that directly.
你也直接将要加上B
32
00:02:09.075 --> 00:02:12.400
And you find that this is much faster.
你将会发现这个非常快
33
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.075
Let's actually illustrate this with a little demo.
让我们用一个小例子说明一下
34
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:21.960
So, here's my Jupiter notebook in which I'm going to write some Python code.
在我的Jupiter notebook 我将会写一些Python代码
35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.041
So, first, let me import the numpy library to import.
首先，让我们导入numpy库
36
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.000
Send nP. And so, for example,
作为 np，例如 
37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.570
I can create A as an array as follows.
像下面这样我将要创建一个数组A
38
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.560
Let's say print A.
 让我们看下打印A
39
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160
Now, having written this chunk of code,
现在，写下这些代码块
40
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.170
if I hit shift enter,
如果我在键盘敲击shift 和 enter 两个键
41
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.847
then it executes the code.
它将要执行这个代码
42
00:02:44.847 --> 00:02:47.970
So, it created the array A and it prints it out.
所以，它创建了数组A以及打印它
43
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.580
Now, let's do the Vectorization demo.
现在，让我们完成向量化的例子
44
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.990
I'm going to import the time libraries,
我将要导入time库
45
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.580
since we use that,
因为我要使用那个
46
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.565
in order to time how long different operations take.
为了去计算两次不同的操作花费了多长时间
47
00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:59.139
Can they create an array A?
他们能创建一个数组A吗
48
00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.905
Those random thought rand.
通过rand函数随机得到
49
00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:10.065
This creates a million dimensional array with random values.
用随机值创建了一个百万维度的数组
50
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.300
b = np.random.rand.
b = np.random.rand.
51
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.120
Another million dimensional array.
另外一个百万维度的数组
52
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.810
And, now, tic=time.time, so this measure the current time,
现在 tic=time.time，记录一下当前时间
53
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.395
c = np.dot (a, b).
c = np.dot (a, b).
54
00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:28.649
toc = time.time.
toc = time.time.
55
00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.950
And this print,
打印一下
56
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.857
it is the vectorized version.
向量化的版本
57
00:03:34.857 --> 00:03:37.685
It's a vectorize version.
这是一个向量化的版本
58
00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:41.985
And so, let's print out.
现在让我们打印一下
59
00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:45.060
Let's see the last time,
让我们看一下运行时间
60
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.330
so there's toc - tic x 1000,
python代码*  toc - tic x 1000
61
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.075
so that we can express this in milliseconds.
所以我们表达这个在毫秒级上
62
00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:54.075
So, ms is milliseconds.
ms代表毫秒
63
00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:56.435
I'm going to hit Shift Enter.
我将要同时敲击Shift和 Enter
64
00:03:56.435 --> 00:04:01.890
So, that code took about three milliseconds or this time 1.5,
所以这个代码花费3毫秒或者这个时间的1.5倍
65
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.170
maybe about 1.5 or 3.5 milliseconds at a time.
或许大概 1.5 或者3.5毫秒 
66
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.370
It varies a little bit as I run it,
它有点变化当我再次运行它的时候
67
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.085
but looks like maybe on average it's taking like 1.5 milliseconds,
但是好像，平均她要花费1.5毫秒
68
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.665
maybe two milliseconds as I run this.
或许我这次运行是2毫秒
69
00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:16.967
All right.
是的
70
00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:19.005
Let's keep adding to this block of code.
让我们继续增加这个代码
71
00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:22.270
That's not implementing non-vectorize version.
这是非向量化的版本
72
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.151
Let's see, c = 0,
让我们看看，c=0
73
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:27.750
then tic = time.time.
 tic = time.time.
74
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.335
Now, let's implement a for loop.
现在它实现了一个for 循环
75
00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:35.348
For I in range of 1 million,
python 代码:for i in range 1:1000000
76
00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:38.676
I'll pick out the number of zeros right.
我将要取出0右边的数字
77
00:04:38.676 --> 00:04:43.936
C += (a,i) x (b,
C += (a,i) x (b,i)
78
00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:50.775
i), and then toc = time.time.
以及 toc = time.time.
79
00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:57.725
Finally, print more than explicit for loop.
最后，打印for loop
80
00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:15.225
The time it takes is this 1000 x toc - tic + "ms"
它花费的时间是1000*toc-tic ms
81
00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:17.505
to know that we're doing this in milliseconds.
为了知道我们正在做这个在毫秒级别
82
00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:19.735
Let's do one more thing.
让我们再做点其他的事情
83
00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:22.802
Let's just print out the value of C we
我们打印出C的值。
84
00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:27.960
compute it to make sure that it's the same value in both cases.
计算一下它，确认在两个案例中他们是相同的。
85
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.770
I'm going to hit shift enter to run this and check that out.
我打算去敲击shift和enter去运行这个，检查一下结果
86
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.305
In both cases, the vectorize version
在两个案例中，向量化版本
87
00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:41.125
and the non-vectorize version computed the same values,
和非向量化版本计算了相同的值
88
00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:45.355
as you know, 2.50 to 6.99, so on.
正如你知道的，2.50 到 6.99
89
00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:48.670
The vectorize version took 1.5 milliseconds.
向量化版本花费了1.5毫秒
90
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:57.555
The explicit for loop and non-vectorize version took about 400, almost 500 milliseconds.
很明确，for loop和非向量化版本花费了大约400，几乎500毫秒
91
00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:01.285
The non-vectorize version took something like 300
非向量化版本多花费了300
92
00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:05.660
times longer than the vectorize version.
倍向量化版本的时间
93
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.230
With this example you see that if only you remember to vectorize your code,
用这个例子你将会看见如果你仅仅记住去向量化你的代码
94
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.120
your code actually runs over 300 times faster.
你的代码完全运行300倍快
95
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.540
Let's just run it again.
让我们再次运行一下它
96
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.930
Just run it again.
再次运行一下它
97
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.235
Yeah. Vectorize version 1.5 milliseconds seconds and the for loop.
向量化版本1.5毫秒，循环使用了
98
00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:25.960
So 481 milliseconds, again,
481毫秒
99
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.535
about 300 times slower to do the explicit for loop.
大约慢300倍用循环做这个
100
00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:30.980
If the time slows down,
如果时间变慢
101
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.880
it's the difference between your code taking maybe one minute to
这个有很大的不同在你的代码花费一分钟去运行和
102
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.615
run versus taking say five hours to run.
花费5个小时去运行
103
00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:41.410
And when you are implementing deep learning algorithms,
当你正在实现深度学习算法
104
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.300
you can really get a result back faster.
你能真正的快速得到一个返回的结果
105
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.590
It will be much faster if you vectorize your code.
它将会更快，如果你向量化你的代码
106
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.300
Some of you might have heard that a lot of
你可能听过很多这样的话
107
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.260
scaleable deep learning implementations are done on a GPU or a graphics processing unit.
大规模的深度学习使用了GPU或者图像处理单元实现
108
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.515
But all the demos I did just now in the Jupiter notebook where actually on the CPU.
但是我做的所有的案例都是在Jupiter notebook上面实现，这里只有CPU
109
00:06:59.515 --> 00:07:04.530
And it turns out that both GPU and CPU have parallelization instructions.
CPU和GPU都有并行化的指令
110
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.530
They're sometimes called SIMD instructions.
他们有时候会叫做SIMD指令
111
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.190
This stands for a single instruction multiple data.
这个代表了一个单独指令多维数据
112
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.045
But what this basically means is that,
这个的基础意义是什么？
113
00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:16.835
if you use built-in functions such as this
如果你使用了built-in函数，像这样
114
00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:23.495
np.function or other functions that don't require you explicitly implementing a for loop.
np.function 或者 并不要求你实现循环的函数
115
00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:28.150
It enables Python numpy to take
python的numpy充分
116
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.640
much better advantage of parallelism to do your computations much faster.
利用并行化去更快的计算
117
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.610
And this is true both computations on CPUs and computations on GPUs.
这是事实在GPU和CPU上面计算
118
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.070
It's just that GPUs are remarkably good at
GPU更加擅长
119
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.980
these SIMD calculations but CPU is actually also not too bad at that.
SIMD计算但是CPU事实上也不是太差
120
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.510
Maybe just not as good as GPUs.
可能没有GPU那么擅长吧
121
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.660
You're seeing how vectorization can significantly speed up your code.
你看下，怎么向量化能够加速你的代码
122
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.685
The rule of thumb to remember is whenever possible,
经验法则是无论什么时候
123
00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:57.425
avoid using explicit four loops.
避免使用显式的for循环
124
00:07:57.425 --> 00:07:59.980
Let's go onto the next video to see some more examples of
让我们进入到下一个视频去看下更多的向量化的案例
125
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.000
vectorization and also start to vectorize logistic regression.
和开始去向量化逻辑回归
